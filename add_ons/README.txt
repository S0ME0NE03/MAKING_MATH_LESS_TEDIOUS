---!#RULES FOR UPLOADING FILES HERE#!---

THIS IS A CHECKLIST THAT YOU MUST FOLLOW BEFORE UPLOADING ANYTHING HERE

1. The file names in here cannot be already exisiting names. for example i named a file "test" but it doesent work since that already exists in python
2. All files should contain a function called "main"
3. Files posted in the add_ons folder may NEVER have invalid syntax. I tried to handle invalid syntax in the program but you cant even handle
  wrong syntax modules in python while importing


SOMETHING TO NOTE
  -The raw file takes a little bit of time to actually update so yeah keep that in mind
  -Github api can be a little slow to update stuff
