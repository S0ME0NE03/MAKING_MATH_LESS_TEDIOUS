---!#RULES FOR UPLOADING FILES HERE#!---

THIS IS A CHECKLIST THAT YOU MUST FOLLOW BEFORE UPLOADING ANYTHING HERE

1. The file names in here cannot be already exisiting names. for example i named a file "test" but it doesent work since that already exists in python
2. All files should contain a function called "main"
