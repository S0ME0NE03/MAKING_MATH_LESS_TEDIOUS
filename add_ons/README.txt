---!#RULES FOR UPLOADING FILES HERE#!---

THIS IS A CHECKLIST THAT YOU MUST FOLLOW BEFORE UPLOADING ANYTHING HERE

1. The file names in here cannot be already exisiting names. for example i named a file "test" but it doesent work since that already exists in python
2. All files should contain a function called "main"


SOMETHING TO NOTE
If you manually delete an add_on, and the add_on is still in the pycache folder, then if you make changes on the github website to the file and try to download again, changes will not be made,
it will just load the pycache thing instead of actually donwloading it anew. This means that if we make a delete and update function, that we will have to either delete the enitire pycache folder, or just the cache file

Just did further testing and maybe this isint true, I think it just takes a long time for the actual website to update its backend
