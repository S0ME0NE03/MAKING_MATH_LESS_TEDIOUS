# •○• How to use •○•

download the required progam and launch it like you would any other python program

math_launcher.py is purely a tool to launch the other programs in the repo via command line with greater ease it does not include the programs.

#Developer's notes
  !IMPORTANT!
    -All add_ons modules NEED to have a main() function which is where the start of the code begins.
    -ALL files in the add_ons folder (stored in server) MUST have a .py extension
